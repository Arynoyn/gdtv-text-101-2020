  storyText: 'You instinctively duck and roll forward while pivoting around on your
    heels. As you do you feel the rush of something just miss your head. Coming to
    your feet a blaster, much like the one in your favorite game appears in your
    hand and you see a large hulk with a mace, seemingly made from scraps of some
    machine, winding up for another go at your head. Without thought you pull the
    trigger and the hulk disintegrates into thin air. "Whoo Hoo!" you hear the excited
    "you that isn''t you" scream into your earring. "Now let''s portal out of here."
