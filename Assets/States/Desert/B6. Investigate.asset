    swim in the oasis but you decide that you might be able to find out more about
    where you are. As you round the tree...there is nothing there! Confused you circle
    the tree once and then turn back to the oasis satisfied you are alone and just
    hearing things. As you stroll back to where you were removing your clothing you
    feel a sudden pain in the back of your head and a hear a loud crack to go with
    it. As your sight fades you see two booted feet appear next to your face where
    you landed in the desert sand. and then it fades to black.
